For example, is it ethical for a doctor to administer pain medication to a terminally ill patient, knowing that it will hasten their death?\n\n3. The Prisoner's Dilemma: A scenario in which two suspects are arrested for a crime and are being interrogated separately. The dilemma is whether to confess and betray their partner in crime to receive a lighter sentence, or stay silent and risk a harsher punishment if their partner confesses.\n\n4. The Veil of Ignorance: A thought experiment in which decision-makers are asked to consider a situation without knowing their own social status, race, or gender.
